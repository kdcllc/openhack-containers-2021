# Locking it Down

Youâ€™ve done a lot of work so far to make sure your security and monitoring were in place, but there is still work to do to improve the security of your cluster.

## Challenge

Your CTO is feeling confident in what your team has been able to accomplish, but there are still some security concerns you will need to address. After all, when dealing with sensitive information, security is one of the top concerns. In this challenge you must work to increase the security of your cluster by meeting these requirements:

1.  Services in your cluster should only be able to make requests to other services if explicitly required.
2.  None of the deployed services should be able to communicate with the api server.
3.  None of the applications should run as root. This should be enforced by default.
4.  Limit the egress traffic to only what is necessary.
5.  Your CTO requires that access to your KeyVault should not require a secret stored in the cluster. Reassess your current use of KeyVault and ensure it is up to these guidelines.

## Success Criteria

*   **Your team** restricted access from the deployed services access to kube-apiserver
*   **Your team** limited the access to the Kubernetes API Server to only machines from your location
*   **Your team** demonstrated that the API applications cannot call each other
*   **Your team** restricted ability to deploy applications that have root access
*   **Your team** limited the egress traffic from the cluster
*   **Your team** enabled sql server access from inside the vnet only
*   **Your team** enabled KeyVault access without the need for a secret stored in the cluster
